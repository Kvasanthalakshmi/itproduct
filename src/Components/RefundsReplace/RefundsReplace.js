      <p>
        It may take up to 7-10 working days to complete the refund from the time we have received our product back. Though we provide free shipping during the cancel and refund, the shipping charge will be deducted from the refund amount. If the order is cancelled before shipping, there will not be any shipping charge deducted from the refund funds. In case the payment was done through COD, it will take longer. As soon as we receive the funds from the courier, we will process the refund. You need to provide us with the below-mentioned information:

      </ul>
      
      <h2>Refund Method</h2>
      <p>
        We will either transfer the funds to your account or provide you with a cheque under the billing address name.
      </p>

      <h2>Terms and Conditions for Cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        If you cancel your order before your product has been shipped, we will refund the entire amount. If the cancellation is after your product has been shipped:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If your product has shipped but has not yet been delivered, contact Customer Support and inform them of the same.</li>
        <li>If you received the product, it will only be eligible for replacement in cases where defects are found with the product.</li>
        <li>When the product is delivered by courier and the customer does not accept the package, the two-way shipment charge will be collected from the Customer.</li>
      </ul>
